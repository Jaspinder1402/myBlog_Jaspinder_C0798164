                    Canada is a country in North America. Its ten provinces and three territories extend from the
                    Atlantic
                    to the Pacific and northward into the Arctic Ocean, covering 9.98 million square kilometres (3.85
                    million square miles), making it the world's second-largest country by total area. Its southern and
                    western border with the United States, stretching 8,891 kilometres (5,525 mi), is the world's
                    longest
                    bi-national land border. Canada's capital is Ottawa, and its three largest metropolitan areas are
                    Toronto, Montreal, and Vancouver.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Indigenous peoples have continuously inhabited what is now Canada for thousands of years. Beginning
                    in
                    the 16th century, British and French expeditions explored and later settled along the Atlantic
                    coast. As
                    a consequence of various armed conflicts, France ceded nearly all of its colonies in North America
                    in
                    1763. In 1867, with the union of three British North American colonies through Confederation, Canada
                    was
                    formed as a federal dominion of four provinces. This began an accretion of provinces and territories
                    and
                    a process of increasing autonomy from the United Kingdom. This widening autonomy was highlighted by
                    the
                    Statute of Westminster 1931 and culminated in the Canada Act 1982, which severed the vestiges of
                    legal
                    dependence on the British Parliament.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Canada is a parliamentary democracy and a constitutional monarchy in the Westminster tradition. The
                    country's head of government is the prime minister—who holds office by virtue of their ability to
                    command the confidence of the elected House of Commons—and is appointed by the governor general,
                    representing the monarch, who serves as head of state. The country is a Commonwealth realm and is
                    officially bilingual at the federal level. It ranks among the highest in international measurements
                    of
                    government transparency, civil liberties, quality of life, economic freedom, and education. It is
                    one of
                    the world's most ethnically diverse and multicultural nations, the product of large-scale
                    immigration
                    from many other countries. Canada's long relationship with the United States has had a significant
                    impact on its economy and culture.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A highly developed country, Canada has the seventeenth-highest nominal per-capita income globally
                    and
                    the sixteenth-highest ranking in the Human Development Index. Its advanced economy is the
                    tenth-largest
                    in the world, relying chiefly upon its abundant natural resources and well-developed international
                    trade
                    networks. Canada is part of several major international and intergovernmental institutions or
                    groupings
                    including the United Nations, NATO, the G7, the Group of Ten, the G20, the Organisation for Economic
                    Co-operation and Development (OECD), the World Trade Organization (WTO), the Commonwealth of
                    Nations,
                    the Arctic Council, the Organisation internationale de la Francophonie, the Asia-Pacific Economic
                    Cooperation forum, and the Organization of American States.

                <h2>Name of Canada</h2>

                <p>
                    While a variety of theories have been postulated for the etymological origins of Canada, the name is
                    now
                    accepted as coming from the St. Lawrence Iroquoian word kanata, meaning "village" or "settlement".
                    In 1535, Indigenous inhabitants of the present-day Quebec City region used the word to direct French
                    explorer Jacques Cartier to the village of Stadacona. Cartier later used the word Canada to refer
                    not only to that particular village but to the entire area subject to Donnacona (the chief at
                    Stadacona); by 1545, European books and maps had begun referring to this small region along the
                    Saint Lawrence River as Canada.
                </p>
                <p>
                    From the 16th to the early 18th century "Canada" referred to the part of New France that lay along
                    the
                    Saint Lawrence River. In 1791, the area became two British colonies called Upper Canada and Lower
                    Canada collectively named the Canadas; until their union as the British Province of Canada in 1841.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Upon Confederation in 1867, Canada was adopted as the legal name for the new country at the London
                    Conference, and the word Dominion was conferred as the country's title. By the 1950s, the term
                    Dominion of Canada was no longer used by the United Kingdom, which considered Canada a "Realm of the
                    Commonwealth". The government of Louis St. Laurent ended the practice of using Dominion in the
                    statutes of Canada in 1951.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In 1982, the passage of the Canada Act, bringing the Constitution of Canada fully under Canadian
                    control, referred only to Canada, while later that year the name of the national holiday was changed
                    from Dominion Day to Canada Day. The term Dominion was used to distinguish the federal government
                    from the provinces, though after the Second World War the term federal had replaced dominion.

                    Indigenous peoples in present-day Canada include the First Nations, Inuit, and Métis, the last being
                    a mixed-blood people who originated in the mid-17th century when First Nations people married
                    European
                    settlers and subsequently developed their own identity.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The first inhabitants of North America are generally hypothesized to have migrated from Siberia by
                    way
                    of the Bering land bridge and arrived at least 14,000 years ago. The Paleo-Indian archeological
                    sites at Old Crow Flats and Bluefish Caves are two of the oldest sites of human habitation in
                    Canada. The characteristics of Indigenous societies included permanent settlements, agriculture,
                    complex societal hierarchies, and trading networks. Some of these cultures had collapsed by the
                    time European explorers arrived in the late 15th and early 16th centuries and have only been
                    discovered
                    through archeological investigations.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Indigenous population at the time of the first European settlements is estimated to have been
                    between 200,000 and two million, with a figure of 500,000 accepted by Canada's Royal Commission
                    on Aboriginal Peoples. As a consequence of European colonization, the Indigenous population declined
                    by forty to eighty percent, and several First Nations, such as the Beothuk, disappeared. The decline
                    is attributed to several causes, including the transfer of European diseases, such as influenza,
                    measles, and smallpox to which they had no natural immunity, conflicts over the fur trade,
                    conflicts with the colonial authorities and settlers, and the loss of Indigenous lands to settlers
                    and
                    the subsequent collapse of several nations' self-sufficiency.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Although not without conflict, European Canadians' early interactions with First Nations and Inuit
                    populations were relatively peaceful. First Nations and Métis peoples played a critical part in the
                    development of European colonies in Canada, particularly for their role in assisting European
                    coureur
                    des bois and voyageurs in their explorations of the continent during the North American fur trade.
                    The Crown and Indigenous peoples began interactions during the European colonization period, though
                    the
                    Inuit, in general, had more limited interaction with European settlers. However, from the late 18th
                    century, European Canadians encouraged Indigenous peoples to assimilate into their own culture.
                    These attempts reached a climax in the late 19th and early 20th centuries with forced integration
                    and
                    relocations. A period of redress is underway, which started with the appointment of the Truth and
                    Reconciliation Commission of Canada by the Government of Canada in 2008.

                <p>
                    It is believed that the first European to explore the east coast of Canada was Norse explorer Leif
                    Erikson. In approximately 1000 AD, the Norse built a small encampment that only lasted a few
                    years at L'Anse aux Meadows on the northern tip of Newfoundland. No further European exploration
                    occurred until 1497, when Italian seafarer John Cabot explored and claimed Canada's Atlantic coast
                    in
                    the name of King Henry VII of England. In 1534, French explorer Jacques Cartier explored the Gulf of
                    Saint Lawrence where, on July 24, he planted a 10-metre (33 ft) cross bearing the words "Long Live
                    the
                    King of France" and took possession of the territory New France in the name of King Francis I. The
                    early 16th century saw European mariners with navigational techniques pioneered by the Basque and
                    Portuguese establish seasonal whaling and fishing outposts along the Atlantic coast. In general,
                    early settlements during the Age of Discovery appear to have been short-lived due to a combination
                    of
                    the harsh climate, problems with navigating trade routes and competing outputs in Scandinavia.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In 1583, Sir Humphrey Gilbert, by the royal prerogative of Queen Elizabeth I, founded St. John's,
                    Newfoundland, as the first North American English seasonal camp. In 1600, the French established
                    their first seasonal trading post at Tadoussac along the Saint Lawrence. French explorer Samuel de
                    Champlain arrived in 1603 and established the first permanent year-round European settlements at
                    Port
                    Royal (in 1605) and Quebec City (in 1608). Among the colonists of New France, Canadiens extensively
                    settled the Saint Lawrence River valley and Acadians settled the present-day Maritimes, while fur
                    traders and Catholic missionaries explored the Great Lakes, Hudson Bay, and the Mississippi
                    watershed to
                    Louisiana. The Beaver Wars broke out in the mid-17th century over control of the North American fur
                    trade.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The English established additional settlements in Newfoundland, beginning in 1610 and the Thirteen
                    Colonies to the south were founded soon after. A series of four wars erupted in colonial North
                    America between 1689 and 1763; the later wars of the period constituted the North American theatre
                    of
                    the Seven Years' War. Mainland Nova Scotia came under British rule with the 1713 Treaty of Utrecht,
                    and Canada and most of New France came under British rule in 1763 after the Seven Years' War.
